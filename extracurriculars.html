            <h1 class="popup-title">Cornell Hyperloop Project Team UI Team Member</h1>
            <p>As a key member of the Cornell Hyperloop Project Team's User Interface (UI) team, I helped design and
                develop an advanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) to support the real-time monitoring,
                visualization, and control of our Hyperloop transoprtation pod. Using Python and the PyQt library,
                I helped develop a user-friendly interface that created a seamless communication link between the
                onboard computer and the external GUI.</p>
            <p>The GUI was designed to display critical sensor readings, subsystem statuses, and control parameters in
                real-time. By integrating data collected via Arduino from multiple onboard sensors and subsystems, I
                ensured the interface provided accurate and timely information. This allowed the team to monitor pod
                performance metrics such as speed, temperature, pressure, and subsystem integrity, enabling efficient
                decision-making during testing and operations.</p>
            <p>Developing this system required extensive collaboration across teams, including the sensor, mechanical,
                and software control groups. I worked closely with the sensor team to ensure seamless data integration,
                with the control team to refine real-time communication protocols, and with the mechanical team to align
                on subsystem designs and their interaction with the GUI. This interdisciplinary approach was critical to
                ensuring the system's accuracy, reliability, and operational success.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for designing the front-end layout to present complex metrics in a clear, intuitive way
                while keeping the interface responsive and visually engaging. On the back-end, I integrated real-time
                data feeds, worked to reduce latency for smoother performance, and ensured the GUI was compatible with
                various subsystems. I also played a key role in testing and debugging, identifying and fixing issues
                that could impact data accuracy or system responsiveness.</p>
            <p>The GUI improved data accessibility for the engineering team during testing and made troubleshooting
                faster by clearly highlighting critical system anomalies. This boosted operational efficiency and
                minimized downtime during test phases. Through this experience, I strengthened my technical skills in
                Python, PyQt, and hardware-software integration, while also enhancing my collaboration and communication
                abilities by working closely with multidisciplinary teams to tackle complex engineering challenges.

            <h1 class="popup-title">Alpha Phi Sorority Member</h1>
            <p>As an active member of Alpha Phi, I am part of a values-driven organization that emphasizes leadership,
                sisterhood, and meaningful community engagement. Our chapter is deeply committed to philanthropy, with a
                particular focus on supporting women’s heart health through the Alpha Phi Foundation.</p>
            <p>One of our most impactful initiatives is Heart Health Week, where we organize a series of fundraisers and
                events to raise awareness and funds for heart health research and education. These activities, such as
                bake sales, merchandise sales, and informational workshops, engage both the campus and the local
                community in this important cause.</p>
            <p>I also take part in our signature event, the Red Dress Gala, a formal evening that brings together
                chapter members, alumni, and supporters to celebrate our philanthropic mission. The event features
                auctions, raffles, and donor recognition programs, helping us raise significant funds for the Alpha Phi
                Foundation while fostering a spirit of unity and generosity among attendees.</p>
            <p>Through my involvement, I have gained valuable organizational and teamwork skills while contributing to
                meaningful causes that align with Alpha Phi’s mission of empowering women and making a positive impact.
                Additionally, I have found a supportive community of strong, driven women who inspire and encourage one
                another to grow both personally and professionally. This sense of sisterhood has further strengthened my
                commitment to Alpha Phi’s values and mission.</p>

            <h1 class="popup-title">Cornell Guiding Eyes Member</h1>
            <p>As a member of Cornell Guiding Eyes, I contribute to a program focused on raising and training guide dogs
                to assist individuals with visual impairments. My role includes supporting various stages of the dogs'
                development, with an emphasis on socializing them and preparing them for their future responsibilities
                as service animals.</p>
            <p>My work involves exposing the dogs to a variety of environments and situations, including campus
                settings,
                public spaces, and interactions with people. These experiences help the dogs build confidence and
                adaptability, ensuring they are ready for the real-world challenges they will face as guide dogs.
                Through
                this, I’ve gained a deep appreciation for the profound impact these animals have in improving
                accessibility
                and independence for visually impaired individuals.</p>
            <p>My involvement with Cornell Guiding Eyes stems from a longstanding passion for working with service
                animals,
                which began during high school when I volunteered at the Guide Dog Foundation. Continuing this work in
                college has deepened my dedication to programs that empower individuals with visual impairments and
                strengthened my belief in the vital role guide dogs play in fostering independence and inclusion.</p>
            <p>Being part of Cornell Guiding Eyes allows me to contribute to a life-changing cause while enhancing my
                skills
                in patience, responsibility, and teamwork. This experience has reinforced my commitment to community
                service and highlighted the importance of creating inclusive, supportive environments where everyone can
                thrive.</p>

            <h1 class="popup-title">Society of Women Engineers Fundraising (SWE) Committee Member</h1>
            <p>As a member of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) Fundraising Committee, I played an active role in
                supporting initiatives that advance women in engineering. My responsibilities included organizing and
                managing creative fundraising events that provided critical resources for SWE’s programs, outreach
                activities, and scholarships.</p>
            <p>I collaborated closely with team members to brainstorm and implement successful fundraisers, such as
                partnering with local restaurants, selling student care packages, and coordinating donut sales. These
                events not only generated significant funds but also engaged the broader campus community in SWE’s
                mission to empower women in STEM.</p>
            <p>In addition to planning events, I managed logistics such as securing venues, overseeing budgets, and
                promoting fundraisers through digital and in-person outreach. This required strong teamwork and clear
                communication to ensure each event was executed smoothly and achieved its financial goals.</p>
            <p>This experience helped me develop practical skills in event planning, problem-solving, and collaboration
                while contributing to SWE’s ability to provide scholarships, professional development opportunities, and
                outreach programs. Being part of the committee deepened my understanding of how effective fundraising
                can support meaningful initiatives that inspire and uplift the next generation of women engineers.</p>

            <h1 class="popup-title">CUEmpower Mentee</h1>
            <p>I participated in CUEmpower, a mentoring program focused on supporting minority freshmen in the College
                of Engineering by creating a welcoming community and providing essential guidance during their
                transition to university life. The program aims to help students navigate the academic, social, and
                personal challenges of their first year in a demanding engineering environment.</p>
            <p>As a participant, I attended workshops and engaged in one-on-one mentorship sessions that provided
                practical insights into academic success strategies, effective time management, and career development
                opportunities. These activities equipped me with valuable resources to better understand and utilize
                campus support systems, including tutoring services, student organizations, and professional networks.
            </p>
            <p>I also took part in group activities designed to foster community among participants, creating a
                collaborative and supportive environment where minority engineering students could connect, share their
                experiences, and learn from one another. This community became a source of encouragement and belonging
                during my first year of college.</p>
            <p>Through my involvement in CUEmpower, I developed a deep appreciation for the importance of mentorship and
                the impact of programs that promote diversity and inclusion in STEM. This experience motivated me to
                step into a mentoring role myself, where I now help underrepresented students navigate their own
                academic and personal journeys, fostering their growth and success in engineering.</p>
